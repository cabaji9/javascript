# javascript
I will keep updating with pieces of base code from my projects.
This is based on another javascript project. but i updated to use touch for mobile,
angular, and jquery.

Its not the finished product but a mock i made for another project. But i could be used to another projects as a base.

The tarot_game you must have bower to update all dependencies. 
run it with bower install.
